# @stowage/conformance

The cases every stowage adapter has to pass, as plain cases a test framework maps onto its own runner.

The package is not released yet and exports no API. What it will hold is written in
[`docs/spec.md`](https://github.com/stowage-js/stowage/blob/main/docs/spec.md#8-stowageconformance), which is the contract: a caller may rely on what that document
states and on nothing else a package happens to export.

## Runtimes

Node 24 and later, Bun, Deno and `workerd` at the compatibility date `2026-09-01`. The Bun and Deno versions CI last ran green are named here once CI has run them.
